# Gravity Webpage

A simple webpage with a button to add boxes around the page and then collapsing them via the "activation of gravity". It is also possible to stop the collapse as well as add more items during the collapse.

## Build the Project

Just be sure to have the TypeScript compiler installed and the just run the build script with

`npm run build`

This is a modified version of the original script that compiles the ts code and copies all the contents of the public folder (mainly `index.html`) into the dist folder.
